@article{Fabian2006,
abstract = {Young mid-ocean ridge basalts contain titanomagnetite crystals of varying size and composition. Many studies of their hysteresis properties have found Mrs/ Ms ratios considerably above the theoretical limit of 0.5 for uniaxial single domain particles. Since titanomagnetite is a cubic mineral, high Mrs/ Ms could occur due to cubic anisotropy which allows for Mrs/Ms values up to 0.866. On the other hand, titanomagnetites with high Ti content possess extremely large magnetostriction constants. Already slight internal stress easily outweighs cubic anisotropy and enforces uniaxial behavior. Are high Mrs/Ms ratios now a proof for very low internal stress? No! On the contrary, previous studies on synthetic titanomagnetite with high Mrs/Ms show that after annealing this ratio decreases. A possible explanation is that insufficient saturation of the hysteresis loop, used to infer Mrs/ Ms, leads to underestimation of Ms. Here, a systematic experimental study on a young mid-ocean ridge basalt using fields of up to 7T demonstrates that indeed the Mrs/Ms ratio of the single domain fraction does not significantly deviate from the theoretical value of 0.5 for uniaxial anisotropy. It is further estimated that internal stress above 200 MPa is necessary to explain the observed hysteresis behavior - a value which is consistent with recent independent approximations. On the other hand, theoretical loops for cubic minerals do not fit the observed data. In order to assess the validity of Ms determinations from hysteresis measurements, an improved method to evaluate the approach to saturation behavior of hysteresis loops is developed. It allows to recognize insufficiently saturated loops and thereby helps to avoid misinterpretation of standard Mrs/Ms measurements when high fields are not accessible. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Dobeneck1996a,
abstract = {The new rock-magnetic method presented here is a series of successive procedures, by which experimental hysteresis and back-field magnetization data are ultimately converted into hyperbolic spectra'. The processing comprises smoothing and centring of raw data, asymptotic slope correction, determination of common hysteresis parameters and modelling of induced and remanent hysteresis components with specially adapted hyperbolic basis functions. The resulting spectral diagrams denote the relative contributions of 10-40 coercivity classes, each representing ferromagnetic particles of a narrow, clearly defined coercivity range. The distribution patterns of these spectra allow the discrimination and quantification of discrete mineral or grain-size fractions and the calculation of their partial hysteresis loops. A computer program ('HYSTEAR') for interactive and automated hysteresis loop data processing applying the algorithms described is available from the author.},

@article{King1982,
abstract = {A new rapid method for identifying relative grain size variations in magnetic involves the parameter anhysteretic susceptibility ($\chi$ARM, i.e. specific ARM obtained in a 1 Oe steady field), which is particularly sensitive to the single domain (SD) and small pseudo-single domain (PSD) grains of the finer magnetite fraction. A second parameter, low-field susceptibility ($\chi$), is relatively more sensitive to the coarser magnetite fraction (larger PSD and smaller multidomain (MD) grains). We can then obtain a measure of the ratio of coarse- to fine-grain magnetite for large numbers of samples by plotting $\chi$ARversus$\chi$. A simple idealized model based on sized magnetite samples is proposed to explain the use of the $\chi$ARMversus$\chi$ plot for detecting relative grain-size changes in the magnetic content of natural materials. The sediments of three lakes that contain magnetite or a similar magnetic carrier and have a wide range of values of $\chi$ARM and $\chi$ are used to test the model.The model is used to interpret the magnetic variations observed, and the interpretations are supported by high-field hysteresis measurements of the same sediments. The combination of the high-field hysteresis method of Day et al. [1] and the $\chi$ARM vs. $\chi$ method is a powerful technique allowing the rapid identification of both the relative grain size and domain state for large numbers of samples containing magnetite. The $\chi$ARMvs.$\chi$ method should be used as an intial means of identifying distinct groups of samples.The high-field hysteresis method should then be applied to a few representative samples from each group to confirm the initial interpretation.},
